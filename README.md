## Part 1: Architectural Strategy for Cloud Transformation

### Scenario

- **Your Role:** Cloud Consultant
- **Client:** GOES — Global, Online E-Commerce and Streaming Content Provider
- **Current State:** On-premises (multiple physical data centers), self-managed
- **Strategic Direction:** Transitioning to a hybrid cloud environment

### Panel Stakeholders (Role-Play)

1. Application Stack Developer
2. Enterprise Architect
3. VP Engineering
4. Internal Business Stakeholder

### Objectives

Choose a cloud provider of your preference and guide the panel through the architectural transformation required.

- Design an architecture using **cloud-native patterns** that supports transitioning existing on-premise applications and infrastructure
- Address challenges of ensuring seamless operation in a **hybrid environment**
- Identify and discuss **potential risks** of moving to the cloud and propose mitigation strategies
- Highlight **opportunities** the cloud provides over their self-managed on-premise setup
- Demonstrate understanding of key transition considerations: **cost, security, scalability, and data management**

> **Note:** This segment does not require Elastic to be included. The focus is on your overall architectural understanding, migration strategy, and ability to identify risks and opportunities. Go both high-level and technically deep.

### Key Considerations

#### Size and Scale
Large multinational business with operations across multiple continents. Millions of active users generating substantial data daily.

#### Data Privacy and Compliance
Operates in regions with strict data privacy regulations (e.g., **GDPR in Europe**). Data storage and processing decisions must reflect these constraints.

#### Complexity of Services
Offers multiple services in parallel:
- Online shopping
- Content streaming
- Online payment processing

#### Peak Periods
Experiences significant traffic spikes (e.g., **Black Friday, Christmas**). Architecture must handle these loads without service disruption.

#### Business Continuity
High availability and resiliency are non-negotiable. Significant downtime directly translates to substantial revenue loss.

#### Innovation Mindset
Culture of frequent experimentation. Architecture must support **rapid changes and deployments**.

### Current State Architecture

### Deliverable

Prepare **diagrams** to visualize your architectural design.

> **Template:** Download the [Elastic-branded PowerPoint template](presentations/goes-cloud-transformation-template.pptx) — 4 pre-structured slides with Elastic branding ready to fill in.

These can represent:
- A step-by-step transformation process
- Various aspects of the final (target) architecture

## Part 2: Data Ingestion and Analysis Using Elastic Stack

### Objective

Use the Elastic platform to ingest and analyze a sample dataset — demonstrating hands-on capability and depth of curiosity about Elastic's products.

### Presentation Expectations

- Walk through your **process and findings**
- Explain your choices and the challenges encountered
- Discuss what your **visualizations and dashboards** reveal about the dataset
- Demonstrate the ability to gather data, search/filter it, and visualize results

---

## Exercises

### Prerequisites

**[Create an Elastic Cloud Trial](https://cloud.elastic.co/)**

1. Save the `elastic` user and its corresponding password
2. Once the instance is running, save your **Cloud ID**

---

### Exercise 1: Observability Stack Setup

#### Collect Metrics via System Integration (Elastic Agent)

- Follow Elastic Agent instructions to collect metrics from your local machine
- **Disable log collection** for the system integration
- Navigate to **Observability → Infrastructure → Hosts** (may need to be enabled)

**Create 2 Alerts/Rules:**

| # | Condition | Notification |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Average `system.cpu.system.pct` > 50% for last 1 min | Email alert |
| 2 | Average `system.memory.used.pct` > 85% for last 1 min | Email alert |

> **Bonus:** Customize alert subject and content

---

#### Collect Logs via Logstash

- Use the provided **[Apache access log file](sample-data/apache_access.log.gz)** in this repo (gunzip before use: `gunzip -k sample-data/apache_access.log.gz`)
- Reference the [Logstash Quick Start Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/getting-started-with-logstash.html)
- Use **Logstash file input** and **Elasticsearch output** — see [pipeline.conf](logstash/pipeline.conf) for a starting template
- Apply a prebuilt Logstash grok pattern or define your own
- Create **Kibana visualizations** on points of interest from the Apache log
- Assemble visualizations into a **Kibana dashboard**

> **Bonus:** Create a single-metric **anomaly detection job** to detect excessive high or low log rate (create a data view first if needed)

---

#### Collect APM Traces (OpenTelemetry Demo Shop)

The monitored application is the **[OpenTelemetry Demo (Astronomy Shop)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo)** — a realistic microservices e-commerce application with ~20 services written in Go, Java, Python, .NET, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, and Rust. It ships with full OpenTelemetry instrumentation and a built-in load generator, so traces, metrics, and logs flow continuously without any manual interaction.

**Data flow:**

```
Load Generator (Locust) → OTel Demo Services (~20)
                                    ↓
                        OpenTelemetry Collector
                                    ↓
                  Elastic Cloud  (APM · Metrics · Logs)
```

**Prerequisites:**
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or Docker Engine + Docker Compose v2)
- At least **6 GB RAM** allocated to Docker — check under Settings → Resources before starting
- Your Elastic Cloud deployment running with its APM endpoint and API key ready

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the demo** (outside this repo's directory) and check out a stable release:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo.git
   cd opentelemetry-demo
   git checkout v1.12.0
   ```

2. **Copy in the Elastic configuration files** from this repo:
   ```bash
   cp /path/to/customer-architect-panel/otel/collector-config.yml ./collector-config.yml
   cp /path/to/customer-architect-panel/otel/docker-compose.override.yml ./docker-compose.override.yml
   ```

3. **Edit `collector-config.yml`** — replace the two `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_*` placeholders:
   - `endpoint` — find yours in Kibana under **Observability → Add data → APM → OpenTelemetry**
   - `Authorization` — create an API key in Kibana under **Stack Management → API Keys**, then encode it:
     ```bash
     echo -n "<id>:<secret>" | base64
     ```

4. **Start the stack** (first run pulls ~3 GB of images — do this before your interview):
   ```bash
   docker compose up --detach
   ```

5. **Verify telemetry is arriving** in Kibana:
   - **Observability → APM → Services** — ~15 services should appear (cartservice, checkoutservice, frontend, productcatalogservice, etc.)
   - **Observability → APM → Service Map** — live dependency graph across all services
   - **Dashboards** — search for *OpenTelemetry Demo* for a prebuilt overview

6. **Explore the running stack** locally:
   - Storefront UI: `http://localhost:8080`
   - Locust load generator UI: `http://localhost:8089`

7. **Stop when done:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

> **Troubleshooting:** If services appear in APM but metrics are missing, check the collector logs:
> `docker compose logs otelcol --tail 50` — a `401 Unauthorized` means your API key or endpoint needs correcting.
>
> **Override not working?** Copy `collector-config.yml` directly over the demo's own config as a fallback:
> `cp collector-config.yml src/otelcollector/otelcol-config.yml` — then run `docker compose up` without the override file.

> **Bonus:** Pick one:
> - Find a slow or high-error-rate service in the Service Map and drill into a distributed trace spanning at least 3 services — be ready to walk through the flame graph and explain what it shows
> - Add a static resource attribute (e.g. `deployment.environment: interview`) to the collector config's `resource` processor and verify it appears on spans in Kibana
> - Build a Kibana Lens visualization showing p99 latency over time for the `frontend` service and pin it to a dashboard alongside your Apache log visualizations

---

#### Final Question

> How are the vitals of your local host while ingesting data? Were any alerts triggered?

### Exercise 2: Benchmark Elasticsearch with ESRally

- Benchmark against a **remote cluster** using ESRally
- Be prepared to explain:
  - Which **track(s)** you used
  - The **race results**

> **Bonus:** Create your own **[custom track](https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/stable/adding_tracks.html)**

**Resources:**
- [ESRally Documentation](https://esrally.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [ESRally GitHub Repository](https://github.com/elastic/rally)
